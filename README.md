# TodoistnoteApp

Hi all, I am a novice IOS developer and this is my first app
• The web service and task management software suite - todoist.com - was used for the work
• Сlass is used for networking URLSession
• In my application I use the API, with the help of which I implemented the work on:
- data saving;
- uploading data;
- delete data.
• The application is written on MVC pattern, as well as adhering to the principles of S.O.L.I.D
• The CALayer uses UIKit
• Storing and saving data is done only in runtime
• Uses UserDefaults to store data locally to change complition
